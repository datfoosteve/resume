## What is this? <a name="whatisthis"></a>

Seems like to me that this is some kind of bot that automatically commits and updates changes on repositories depending on what user defined "actions" are encoded into it. This github action seems to go through multiple checks and automatically transcribes the resume.json file into html, and then automaticallly deploys it to my github pages.

[This Repository](https://github.com/kelvintaywl/action-jsonresume-export "This Repository") was the one that showed me how to do this.

## Takeaway <a name="tk"></a>

Ive never used a workflow before, im guessing this makes my life much much easier. Also this bot seems to work recursively. cool
I guess the takeaway shows how much control you can have, depending on whether if you can spend the time.
